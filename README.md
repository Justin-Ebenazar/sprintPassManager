# üîê Jortress Vault

**Jortress Vault is a secure, local-only desktop password manager built with Python and Flask, utilizing Webview for a clean, cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI).**

The primary goal of this application is to provide users with a private and reliable way to store their credentials, keeping all sensitive data confined to their local machine.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Local Storage:** All user data and passwords are encrypted and stored locally.
* **Secure Authentication:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext (hashing is used).
* **Intuitive GUI:** Built using a modern Flask front-end rendered via Python Webview.
* **Standalone Executable:** Available as a single, bundled application for easy deployment on Windows.
